# Careers in Computer Science
The career I have chosen to research is video game developer. Video game developers help transform games from a concept or idea into a playable reality by coding visual elements, programming features, and testing iterations of a game unitl it is ready for market.
![workplace image](https://www.gamedesigning.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Epic-Games.jpg)

# The Basics

A few duties and responsibilities that video game developers have include:
```
  - Developing new ideas for game design
  - Translating visual ideas into code
  - Prototyping, iterate, and polish gameplay
  - Collaborating with other designers, producers, artists, and quality     analysts
  - Monitoring game stability across platforms
  - Reviewing existing coe and recommend improvements
  - Porting games or elements from one system to another
  ```
The education required to become a video game developer is a Bachelor's Degree in science or computer science with game development specialty streams.

Video game developers need to develop certain skills that will help them in the workplace. These skills can range from their ability to code to how well they work with others.

A few of the more technical skills that video game developers should have include:
``` 
- The ability to use Unity, a cross-platform game engine where you can    develop 2D and 3D games. Unity is popular for indie and mobile games.

- Knowing how to work in Unreal Engine. Unreal Engine is a 3D creation    platform used for games across a range of platforms.

- Programming in C# and C++. These two programming languages in           particular are very popular and frequently used to devlop games,        mobile apps, and operating systems(C++).
```

Non-technical skills that video game developers should have include:
```
- Creativity
- Passion for video games
- Wide-ranging knowledge of gaming trends
- Collaborative skills
```

The average salary of a video game developer in Canada is $67,500.

# Standard Education
![YorkU logo](https://www.yorku.ca/wp-content/themes/york2020/images/yorku-logo.jpg)
There are many good colleges and universities to go to for a computer science degree. The program I chose to highlight is York University's computer science program (iBSc).

York University is a public university located in Toronto, Ontario.

The requirements to get into this program are:

* OSSD
* ENG4U
* SCH4U or SPH4U
* MHF4U
* 4U math(MCV4U recommended)
* Two additional 4U or M courses
* Minimum average of 75% and no math grade below 65%

In this program, a few of the courses you would take include:

- Data Structures
- Software Design
- Communication Networks
- Artificial Intelligence and Logic Programming
- Database Systems
- Building E-Commerce Systems
- Data Mining
- User Interfaces
- Sciences(iBSc only)

Within the four-year long program, York University has students do co-op placements after their second year to provide them with valuable industry experience and give them a head start with their careers.

# Experiential Learning

There are many things that video game developers can do to gain valuable experience outside of traditional schooling that are critical to getting a job. A few things that I have done to help me learn more include making my own self-starter project, competitions, and volunteering. 

![scratch logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Scratchlogo.svg/1024px-Scratchlogo.svg.png)
In grade 9, I decided to create a game using Scratch since it was the only language I knew at the time. I am still working on it to this day, adding new features and updating it whenever I feel like it. From creating this game I have learned about the complexity of developing a game and how to effectively use Scratch to create video games.

![robotics](https://teamworxteambuilding.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/gallery-robotics3.jpg)
At St. Augustine, I am part of the robotics team. On the robotics team, I'm part of the mechanical design team meaning I'm responsible for helping build the robot and making sure it is competition ready. From being part of this team, I have learned about working with strict deadlines and cooperating with my teammates to make sure that our robot is prepared to compete.

![swimVolunteer](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/swim-lesson-id-mg-01-card.jpg)
I currently volunteer as a swim instructor at a swim school called Russell Aquatics and I volunteered at a center for kids on the spectrum called Aspirations and Discoveries over the summer. I learned about how to lead a group of children, be a good instructor, and how to work well with other staff to make sure that the children are having fun and safe.

Other things that video game developers can do to gain experience outside of school are:

- Internships
- Co-op placements
- Job sharing
- Community service
- Seeking formal work placements
- Career fairs
- Entrepreneurship
- Part-time jobs


Gaining experience outside of school will:

- Develop workplace awareness
- Build transferable skills
- Provide opportunities for full-time positions
- Help assemble networks
- Increase self-confidence, maturity and independence
